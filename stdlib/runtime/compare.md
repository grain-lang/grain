Compares the first argument to the second argument and produces an integer result.
Provides a consistent ordering over all types and is suitable for sorting and other kinds of ordering.
`compare` treats `NaN` differently than the other comparison operators in that it considers `NaN` equal to itself and smaller than any other number.

Parameters:
