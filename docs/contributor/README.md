# Grain Contributor Docs

These docs are meant to be helpful to contributors as they continue improving Grain. If there's a topic not covered here that you think would be helpful, let us know! Additionally, feel free to make any changes that you think would make this information more clear.

If you're new to Grain and want to jump straight into core compiler development, or you're just curious about how things work under the hood, check out the [compiler walkthrough](https://github.com/grain-lang/grain/blob/main/docs/contributor/compiler_walkthrough.md).

If you want to know more about how Grain data structures are stored in memory, check out the [data representations guide](https://github.com/grain-lang/grain/blob/main/docs/contributor/data_representations.md).
