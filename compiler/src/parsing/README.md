# Parsing
This submodule contains code used for the Grain frontend.
While this will certainly evolve over time, the initial version of this
library is heavily inspired by the `parsing` directory of the OCaml
compiler; we try to use their idioms, since they know better than anyone
the best way to write a compiler in OCaml.
