synopsis: "Embed build information inside executable"
description: """
The build-info library allows to access information about how the
executable was built, such as the version of the project at which it
was built or the list of statically linked libraries with their
versions.  It supports reporting the version from the version control
system during development to get an precise reference of when the
executable was built.
