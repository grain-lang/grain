description: """
dune-configurator is a small library that helps writing OCaml scripts that
test features available on the system, in order to generate config.h
files for instance.
Among other things, dune-configurator allows one to:
- test if a C program compiles
- query pkg-config
- import #define from OCaml header files
- generate config.h file
