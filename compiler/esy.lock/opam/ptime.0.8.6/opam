description: """
Ptime has platform independent POSIX time support in pure OCaml. It
provides a type to represent a well-defined range of POSIX timestamps
with picosecond precision, conversion with date-time values,
conversion with [RFC 3339 timestamps][rfc3339] and pretty printing to a
human-readable, locale-independent representation.

The additional Ptime_clock library provides access to a system POSIX
clock and to the system's current time zone offset.

Ptime is not a calendar library.

Ptime has no dependency. Ptime_clock depends on your system
library. Ptime_clock's optional JavaScript support depends on
[js_of_ocaml][jsoo]. Ptime and its libraries are distributed under the
ISC license.

[jsoo]: http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/
