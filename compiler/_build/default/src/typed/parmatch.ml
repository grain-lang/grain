(* Coherence check *)
(*******************)

(* For some of the operations we do in this module, we would like (because it
   simplifies matters) to assume that patterns appearing on a given column in a
   pattern matrix are /coherent/ (think "of the same type").
   Unfortunately that is not always true.
   Consider the following (well-typed) example:
   {[
     type _ t = S : string t | U : unit t
     let f (type a) (t1 : a t) (t2 : a t) (a : a) =
       match t1, t2, a with
       | U, _, () -> ()
       | _, S, "" -> ()
   ]}
   Clearly the 3rd column contains incoherent patterns.
   On the example above, most of the algorithms will explore the pattern matrix
   as illustrated by the following tree:
   {v
                                                   S
                                                -------> | "" |
                             U     | S, "" | __/         | () |
                         --------> | _, () |   \  ¬ S
        | U, _, () | __/                        -------> | () |
        | _, S, "" |   \
                        ---------> | S, "" | ----------> | "" |
                           ¬ U                    S
   v}
   where following an edge labelled by a pattern P means "assuming the value I
   am matching on is filtered by [P] on the column I am currently looking at,
   then the following submatrix is still reachable".
   Notice that at any point of that tree, if the first column of a matrix is
   incoherent, then the branch leading to it can only be taken if the scrutinee
   is ill-typed.
   In the example above the only case where we have a matrix with an incoherent
   first column is when we consider [t1, t2, a] to be [U, S, ...]. However such
   a value would be ill-typed, so we can never actually get there.
   Checking the first column at each step of the recursion and making the
   concious decision of "aborting" the algorithm whenever the first column
   becomes incoherent, allows us to retain the initial assumption in later
   stages of the algorithms.
   ---
   N.B. two patterns can be considered coherent even though they might not be of
   the same type.
   That's in part because we only care about the "head" of patterns and leave
   checking coherence of subpatterns for the next steps of the algorithm:
   ('a', 'b') and (1, ()) will be deemed coherent because they are both a tuples
   of arity 2 (we'll notice at a later stage the incoherence of 'a' and 1).
   But also because it can be hard/costly to determine exactly whether two
   patterns are of the same type or not (eg. in the example above with _ and S,
   but see also the module [Coherence_illustration] in
   testsuite/tests/basic-more/robustmatch.ml).
   For the moment our weak, loosely-syntactic, coherence check seems to be
   enough and we leave it to each user to consider (and document!) what happens
   when an "incoherence" is not detected by this check.
*)

   a "discriminating" pattern on that column (i.e. a non-omega one) and then

(* Compatibility check *)
(***********************)

(* Patterns p and q compatible means:
   there exists value V that matches both, However....

  The case of extension types is dubious, as constructor rebind permits
  that different constructors are the same (and are thus compatible).

  Compilation must take this into account, consider:

  type t = ..
  type t += A|B
  type t += C=A

  let f x y = match x,y with
  | true,A  -> '1'
  | _,C     -> '2'
  | false,A -> '3'
  | _,_     -> '_'

  As C is bound to A the value of f false A is '2' (and not '3' as it would
  be in the absence of rebinding).

  Not considering rebinding, patterns "false,A" and "_,C" are incompatible
  and the compiler can swap the second and third clause, resulting in the
  (more efficiently compiled) matching

  match x,y with
  | true,A  -> '1'
  | false,A -> '3'
  | _,C     -> '2'
  | _,_     -> '_'

  This is not correct: when C is bound to A, "f false A" returns '2' (not '3')



  However, diagnostics do not take constructor rebinding into account.
  Notice, that due to module abstraction constructor rebinding is hidden.

  module X : sig type t = .. type t += A|B end = struct
    type t = ..
    type t += A
    type t += B=A
  end

  open X

  let f x = match x with
  | A -> '1'
  | B -> '2'
  | _ -> '_'

  The second clause above will NOT (and cannot) be flagged as useless.

  Finally, there are two compatibility fonction
   compat p q      ---> 'syntactic compatibility, used for diagnostics.
   may_compat p q --->   a safe approximation of possible compat,
                         for compilation

  Core function :

   In two places in the following function, we check the coherence of the first
   column of (pss + qs).
   If it is incoherent, then we exit early saying that (pss + qs) is not
   satisfiable (which is equivalent to saying "oh, we shouldn't have considered
   that branch, no good result came come from here").

   But what happens if we have a coherent but ill-typed column?
   - we might end up returning [false], which is equivalent to noticing the
   incompatibility: clearly this is fine.
   - if we end up returning [true] then we're saying that [qs] is useful while
   it is not. This is sad but not the end of the world, we're just allowing dead
   code to survive.

(* Ambiguous variable in or-patterns *)
(*************************************)

(* Specification: ambiguous variables in or-patterns.

   The semantics of or-patterns in OCaml is specified with
   a left-to-right bias: a value [v] matches the pattern [p | q] if it
   matches [p] or [q], but if it matches both, the environment
   captured by the match is the environment captured by [p], never the
   one captured by [q].

   While this property is generally well-understood, one specific case
   where users expect a different semantics is when a pattern is
   followed by a when-guard: [| p when g -> e]. Consider for example:

     | ((Const x, _) | (_, Const x)) when is_neutral x -> branch

   The semantics is clear: match the scrutinee against the pattern, if
   it matches, test the guard, and if the guard passes, take the
   branch.

   However, consider the input [(Const a, Const b)], where [a] fails
   the test [is_neutral f], while [b] passes the test [is_neutral
   b]. With the left-to-right semantics, the clause above is *not*
   taken by its input: matching [(Const a, Const b)] against the
   or-pattern succeeds in the left branch, it returns the environment
   [x -> a], and then the guard [is_neutral a] is tested and fails,
   the branch is not taken. Most users, however, intuitively expect
   that any pair that has one side passing the test will take the
   branch. They assume it is equivalent to the following:

     | (Const x, _) when is_neutral x -> branch
     | (_, Const x) when is_neutral x -> branch

   while it is not.

   The code below is dedicated to finding these confusing cases: the
   cases where a guard uses "ambiguous" variables, that are bound to
   different parts of the scrutinees by different sides of
   a or-pattern. In other words, it finds the cases where the
   specified left-to-right semantics is not equivalent to
   a non-deterministic semantics (any branch can be taken) relatively
   to a specific guard.

let pattern_vars p = Ident.Set.of_list (Typedtree.pattern_bound_idents p)

(* Row for ambiguous variable search,
   row is the traditional pattern row,
   varsets contain a list of head variable sets (varsets)

   A given varset contains all the variables that appeared at the head
   of a pattern in the row at some point during traversal: they would
   all be bound to the same value at matching time. On the contrary,
   two variables of different varsets appeared at different places in
   the pattern and may be bound to distinct sub-parts of the matched
   value.

   All rows of a (sub)matrix have rows of the same length,
   but also varsets of the same length.
   Varsets are populated when simplifying the first column
   -- the variables of the head pattern are collected in a new varset.
   For example,
     { row = x :: r1; varsets = s1 }
     { row = (Some _) as y :: r2; varsets  = s2 }
     { row = (None as x) as y :: r3; varsets = s3 }
     { row = (Some x | (None as x)) :: r4 with varsets = s4 }

     (None, { row = r3; varsets = {x, y} :: s3 })
     (Some x, { row = r4; varsets = {} :: s4 })
     (None, { row = r4; varsets = {x} :: s4 })

(*
   To accurately report ambiguous variables, one must consider
   that previous clauses have already matched some values.
   Consider for example:

     | (Foo x, Foo y) -> ...
     | ((Foo x, _) | (_, Foo x)) when bar x -> ...

   The second line taken in isolation uses an unstable variable,
   but the discriminating values, of the shape [(Foo v1, Foo v2)],
   would all be filtered by the line above.

   To track this information, the matrices we analyze contain both
   *positive* rows, that describe the rows currently being analyzed
   (of type Varsets.row, so that their varsets are tracked) and
   *negative rows*, that describe the cases already matched against.

   The values matched by a signed matrix are the values matched by
   some of the positive rows but none of the negative rows. In
   particular, a variable is stable if, for any value not matched by
   any of the negative rows, the environment captured by any of the
   matching positive rows is identical.
