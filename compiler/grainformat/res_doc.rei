/*
 * `willBreak doc` checks whether `doc` contains forced line breaks.
 * This is more or less a "workaround" to make the parent of a `customLayout` break.
 * Forced breaks are not propagated through `customLayout`; otherwise we would always
 * get the last layout the algorithm triesâ€¦
 * This might result into some weird layouts:
 *  [fn(x => {
 *     let _ = x
 *   }), fn(y => {
 *     let _ = y
 *   }), fn(z => {
 *     let _ = z
 *   })]
 *  The `[` and `]` would be a lot better broken out.
 *  Although the layout of `fn(x => {...})` is correct, we need to break its parent (the array).
 *  `willBreak` can be used in this scenario to check if the `fnâ€¦` contains any forced breaks.
 *  The consumer can then manually insert a `breakParent` doc, to manually propagate the
 *  force breaks from bottom to top.
